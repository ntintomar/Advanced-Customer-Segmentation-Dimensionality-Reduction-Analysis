ðŸ“Œ Project Summary

This project focuses on Customer Segmentation using Machine Learning. The dataset is sourced from Kaggleâ€™s Customer Data Clustering repository.

ðŸ”‘ Key Steps:

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handling missing values, transformations for skewed data, and normalization with StandardScaler.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Distribution plots, correlation analysis, and feature insights.

Feature Engineering: Applied transformations (log normalization, scaling).

Clustering: Implemented K-Means and evaluated with metrics such as Silhouette Score.

Visualization: Cluster distributions and customer segmentation patterns for interpretability.

ðŸŽ¯ Objective:

To group customers into meaningful clusters based on their features, enabling better targeted marketing strategies and business decision-making.
